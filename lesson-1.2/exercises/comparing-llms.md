# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!
